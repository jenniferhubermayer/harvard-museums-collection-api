## Overview

### The challenge

For this project we will use the Harvard Museum API to create a digital art gallery. Here it is very important to deal with the parameters of the API.
https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs

Step 1:
You can use the API to display data. If you click on the “see more” button, more data will be loaded and displayed.

Step 2:
You also have a working search function OR filter options.

Step 3:
The search function AND the filter options work.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (desktop only)
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [Harvard Art Museums API](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs)

### Continued Development

- results should not be limited to 100 works
- "showing XX out of XX works": First number is not equal to search results
- "See more" should only be visible if there are works to be shown
